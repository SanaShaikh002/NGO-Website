    <h2>Our Work</h2>
    <p>
      At Navi Swam Dish Foundation, we are dedicated to transforming lives by addressing key areas that impact community wellbeing: Education, Medical Care, Environment, and Livelihood. Our holistic approach ensures sustainable development and empowerment.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that education is the cornerstone of progress. Our programs focus on providing quality education to children from underprivileged backgrounds through scholarships, free learning materials, and after-school tutoring. We also conduct awareness drives to promote the importance of education, especially for girls.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Medical Care</h3>
    <p>
      Access to basic healthcare is vital for healthy communities. We organize free medical camps offering general check-ups, vaccinations, and distribution of medicines. Our health awareness programs educate communities about hygiene, nutrition, maternal care, and prevention of common diseases.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <p>
      Protecting our environment is essential for a sustainable future. We actively engage in tree plantation drives, clean-up campaigns, and promote eco-friendly practices like waste segregation and water conservation within local communities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Livelihood</h3>
    <p>
      Economic empowerment is key to breaking the cycle of poverty. We offer vocational training in skills such as tailoring, handicrafts, and digital literacy, enabling individuals—especially women and youth—to secure better job opportunities and start their own businesses.
